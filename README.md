# Project Title

This is the Blockchain ledger system application for Challenge 18! I create a Record data class that stores
3 attributes: sender, receiver, and amount. I specify a variable type for each.  I modify the Block data class
so it can receive my Record data as one block of the 3 attributes I gave it. 



## Technologies

I am using python version 3.7.10 and am importing the following from the built-in libraries and from functions i've created myself:

import streamlit as st
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, List
import datetime as datetime
import pandas as pd
import hashlib

## Installation Guide

## Usage

Go to the directory where pychain.py is located and run the file by typing streamlit run pychain.py in the command
line and that's it!
